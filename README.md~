# RRT Path-planning algorthim C++ Code

This can be used to do path planning in two-dimensional space using rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithim. In this algorithim, a feature based direction and distance criteria is used which would help in smooth path and fast convergence of algorithim. The more details about these criteria can be found at [documentation](http://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/robotics.iiit.ac.in/uploads/Main/Publications/Rachit_etal_IROS_16.pdf)

### System Requirements
  - Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64 bits)
  - Install QTcreator for compling and running the code
  - Install gnuplot scientific library

### Important parameters
  - bias: its value will be in the range of 0 to 10. More value will help in faster convergence of path towards final position.
  - radius: tolerance of position for goal position.
  - max,min: generates the randoms numbers in between max and min.
  - lambda: convergence rate parameter

### How to run the code
  - Enter the initial and final position
  - Run
